pkginstall
==========

shell script for installing packages via Mac OS X's `installer` program instead of GUI.
Supports rebooting. Future works: support DMGs, customized pkg (like MS Office).

### How to use

Place all your pkg files in the same folder as `pkginstall.sh`, then run
```bash
zsh pkginstall.sh
```

### A note about quickly mounting DMGs

If you want to automatically mount a DMG without having to click 'yes' to an EULA (if one exists) you can use either use [FlashMount] or the `mntdmg` [shell script](mntdmg.sh) or [zsh function](mntdmg.f.zsh).

Note that under Mac OS X 10.8 you'll need to bypass GateKeeper for FlashMount by control-clicking it and choosing 'Open'. You will only need to do that once:
